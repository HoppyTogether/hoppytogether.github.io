thegirlandherbeer has a really nice beer calorie counter, amongst other great content: https://thegirlandherbeer.com/calories-in-beer/

But I was converting from millilitres/pints to fluid ounces to use it.

This version will take inputs of whole / decimal numbers, and fractions in the form 1/3. It will then guess the unit of volume, but you can change it if it's not right.

The result (in kcal/calories) is only an estimate.

Brown ale has the lowest calories > followed closely by lager > pale ale > stout has the highest. This is not taken into account.
